<div id="Key-Features"/>

### Key Features:

1. **Video Calling:** The application allows users to initiate video calls with other participants in real time. It leverages the Agora RTC SDK to establish reliable and high-quality video communication.

2. **User Signup:** Users can create new accounts by registering their credentials, including username, email address, and password. The signup process ensures password matching functionality to validate accurate password input.

3. **Forget Password:** If users forget their passwords, they can utilize the "Forget Password" feature to initiate a password reset process. This typically involves sending a password reset link or verification code to the user's registered email address.

4. **Mic Mute/Unmute:** During a video call, participants can easily control their microphone's audio input by toggling the mic mute/unmute functionality. This allows users to silence or enable their audio as desired.

5. **Camera Mute/Unmute:** Participants can control their camera's video feed during a video call. By using the camera mute/unmute functionality, users can turn off or resume their video streaming according to their preferences.

6. **End Call Functionality:** Users have the ability to terminate ongoing video calls using the end call feature. This action disconnects the call and returns participants to the application's main interface.

7. **Responsive Web Application:** The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal user experience across a variety of devices and screen sizes. It automatically adapts its layout and functionality to provide a seamless video calling experience on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices.
